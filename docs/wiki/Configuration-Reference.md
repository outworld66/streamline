## Sources and precedence

Configuration is assembled by [koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf) from three layers, later overriding earlier:

1. **Built-in defaults** — every key has one
2. **The config file** — YAML, at `--config` / `-c`
3. **Environment variables** — `STREAMLINE_`-prefixed

Every key is optional. An unset key falls back to its default, so a minimal config file is legitimate — you only need to state what you're changing.

Generate a file containing every key at its default:

```bash
streamline config init --output ~/.config/streamline/config.yaml
```

Validate one before restarting into it:

```bash
streamline config validate --config ~/.config/streamline/config.yaml
```

`config validate` also reads from stdin, which makes it usable in CI.

---

## Environment variables

Prefix `STREAMLINE_`. **A double underscore (`__`) is the path separator; a single underscore is literal.** That distinction is what keeps keys with underscores in their names reachable.

| Config key | Environment variable |
| --- | --- |
| `log.app.level` | `STREAMLINE_LOG__APP__LEVEL` |
| `auth.session_secret` | `STREAMLINE_AUTH__SESSION_SECRET` |
| `auth.seed_admin.password` | `STREAMLINE_AUTH__SEED_ADMIN__PASSWORD` |
| `metadata.tmdb_api_key` | `STREAMLINE_METADATA__TMDB_API_KEY` |
| `otel.endpoint` | `STREAMLINE_OTEL__ENDPOINT` |
| `library.import_mode` | `STREAMLINE_LIBRARY__IMPORT_MODE` |

Arrays (`indexers`, `download_clients`, `auth.oidc`, `quality_profiles`, `custom_formats`) can't be expressed sensibly as environment variables. Put them in the file and use [`_file` secret references](#secrets) for the sensitive parts.

One non-prefixed variable is also read: **`STREAMLINE_PUBLIC_URL`** sets the canonical external base URL, used for OIDC redirect URIs and invite links. Without it, Streamline derives a base from `http://<server.host>:<server.port>`.

### torrent_listen_port

A top-level key that overrides the built-in download client's own `listen_port`:

```yaml
torrent_listen_port: 61847
```

It is top-level, rather than another field on the `download_clients` entry, so that the environment can reach it — a single underscore is literal and `__` is the path separator, so **`STREAMLINE_TORRENT_LISTEN_PORT`** names it exactly, while nothing *inside* `download_clients[]` is addressable at all.

That matters for one situation: peering through a commercial VPN that assigns a **forwarded port per session**. Such a port rotates on every reconnect or server change, so it cannot be written into a config file that git owns and mounts read-only.

Behaviour worth knowing:

- **It wins wherever it is set.** The entry's own `listen_port` is ignored — a forwarded port is the only value that can be right, and a file naming a different one is stale by construction. Leave it at `0` (the default) to use the entry's value.
- **It is read at startup, but that's only the initial bind.** `PUT /api/v1/torrents/listen-port` (admin) moves the running engine's peer sockets to a new port without a restart — it's the endpoint a gluetun sidecar should call on every port reassignment:

  ```yaml
  VPN_PORT_FORWARDING: "on"
  VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND: '/bin/sh -c "curl -sS --fail -X PUT -H \"X-API-Key: $API_KEY\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"port\\\":{{PORT}}}\" http://streamline:8080/api/v1/torrents/listen-port"'
  ```

  An API key works here even though keys are otherwise locked out of parts of the API — that restriction is scoped to the identity band (`/auth/*`, `/users`), and this endpoint isn't on it. The move is **not persisted**: it only changes what the running process is doing right now, so a restart re-reads `torrent_listen_port`/`STREAMLINE_TORRENT_LISTEN_PORT` from config as before. Keep the sidecar's `UP_COMMAND` as the source of truth for the *current* port; don't expect the config file to reflect it.
- **Peers find you again at different speeds.** A completed move immediately re-announces every torrent to the DHT, which carries the new port straight away. Trackers are not re-announced — there is no way to force that in the torrent library Streamline pins — so a tracker keeps advertising the old port until its next scheduled announce, which on a private tracker can be half an hour. Nothing is lost in the meantime; inbound connections to the old port simply fail until the announce catches up.
- **It is validated like any port.** A value outside 1–65535 fails config validation at boot rather than being silently ignored.
- **It applies to the built-in engine only.** External clients (qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge) manage their own listening port; Streamline never sets it for them.

Without a forwarded port, peering is outbound-only: downloads work, uploads stay at zero because nothing can open a connection to you.

## Secrets

Every secret-bearing key has a `_file` twin that reads the value from a path instead. The file's contents are trimmed of surrounding whitespace. When both are set, **the file wins**.

| Inline | File |
| --- | --- |
| `auth.session_secret` | `auth.session_secret_file` |
| `auth.seed_admin.password` | `auth.seed_admin.password_file` |
| `auth.oidc[].client_secret` | `auth.oidc[].client_secret_file` |
| `metadata.tmdb_api_key` | `metadata.tmdb_api_key_file` |
| `metadata.tvdb_api_key` | `metadata.tvdb_api_key_file` |
| `indexers[].api_key` | `indexers[].api_key_file` |
| `download_clients[].password` | `download_clients[].password_file` |
| `download_clients[].api_key` | `download_clients[].api_key_file` |
| `media_server.servers[].api_key` | `media_server.servers[].api_key_file` |

This is what makes Streamline work cleanly with Docker secrets, SOPS, sealed-secrets and Vault Agent — the config file stays in git, the values arrive as mounted files.

### Values Streamline generates for itself

Two values are generated on first boot and **written back into your config file** if they're empty:

- **`auth.session_secret`** — the JWT HMAC signing key. Regenerating it invalidates every session.
- **`media_server.plex_client_id`** — the `X-Plex-Client-Identifier` this instance presents.

A third, `auth.seed_admin.password`, is generated and persisted only when you asked for a seeded admin without supplying a password.

With no writable config file (a `:ro` mount, `read_only: true`, or no file at all) the session secret falls back to an **ephemeral** value, regenerated at every start.

> [!WARNING]
> An ephemeral session secret means everyone is logged out on every restart. For any deployment where the config isn't writable, supply `auth.session_secret` explicitly. See [GitOps and Kubernetes](GitOps-and-Kubernetes).

## What's editable at runtime

Some config is hot — changed through the UI or API, applied immediately, persisted back to the file. The rest requires an edit and a restart.

| Area | Runtime-editable? | Where in the UI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Indexers, download clients, media servers | ✅ Full CRUD | Settings → Connections |
| Quality profiles, custom formats | ✅ Full CRUD | Settings → Library |
| `quality_default_profile` | ✅ The ★ button on a profile row | Settings → Quality profiles |
| Schedule intervals, pause/resume/run | ✅ | Settings → Schedules |
| `auth.registration_mode`, `auth.session_ttl`, `auth.default_role` | ✅ | Settings → Authentication |
| `auth.lockout.{threshold,window,duration}` | ✅ | Settings → Authentication |
| `library.monitor_specials` | ✅ | Settings → Series |
| `library.probe.*` | ✅ Applies to the next import — see [Import verification](#import-verification) | Settings → Media probe |
| `library.{movie,series}_naming` | ✅ Applies to the next import or rename | Settings → Library |
| `library.import_mode`, `keep_torrent_seeding`, `import_max_attempts`, `allowed_download_roots` | ✅ | Settings → Library |
| `library.no_match_cooldown`, `max_grab_failures`, `drift_grace_ticks` | ✅ | Settings → Library |
| `download.selective_files`, `download.selection_grace`, `download.path_mappings` | ✅ | Settings → Library |
| `ffmpeg.enabled` | ✅ | Settings → Media probe |
| `ffmpeg.path` | ⚠️ Accepted immediately, but only picked up by the process's prober on the next restart | Settings → Media probe |
| `transcoding.{enabled,max_concurrent,max_failures,defer_seeding,hw_accel,hw_device,verify.*}` | ✅ Read on every worker tick — no restart | Settings → Transcoding |
| `quality_profiles[].transcode` | ⚠️ API and YAML only — the profile form does not edit it | — |
| `events.retention` | ✅ Applies on the next cleanup run | Settings → General |
| `metadata.*` | ⚠️ Accepted immediately, but the TMDB and TVDB clients are built at boot — restart required | Settings → Metadata |
| `log.*`, `otel.endpoint` | ⚠️ Accepted immediately, but the log handlers and OTLP exporters are built at boot — restart required | Settings → General |
| OIDC providers | ⚠️ CRUD works, but only loaded at startup — restart required | Settings → Single Sign-On |
| Everything else | ❌ File only, restart required | — |

Notably **not** runtime-editable: `data_dir`, server host/port, `server.trusted_proxies`, `auth.mode`, `auth.trusted_networks`, `auth.trusted_role`, `auth.seed_admin.*` and the session secrets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The trust-boundary keys are deliberately file-only — the same reason the [OIDC](Authentication-and-SSO) provider API never exposes `allow_admin` or `email_linking`.

They are all **shown** read-only under **Server & security** on Settings → General, so one screen can tell you what is in force without reading the YAML on the host. Secrets appear there as a source (`In the config file` / `From a file` / `Not set`), never as a value.

[![Settings — runtime snapshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataHearth/streamline/main/docs/assets/settings.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataHearth/streamline/main/docs/assets/settings.png)

**`torrent_listen_port` is its own thing.** It is not editable as config at all, because the value is authored by a VPN tunnel rather than by you: `PUT /api/v1/torrents/listen-port` moves the *running* engine's peer sockets and re-announces to DHT without writing anything, so a restart falls back to `STREAMLINE_TORRENT_LISTEN_PORT`. The normal caller is gluetun's `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND` on every port rotation; **Move listening port** on Activity → Torrents is the manual re-issue for when that hook fails, since nothing retries it automatically.

**Three settings name the peer port; only one of them wins.** `download_clients[].listen_port` is what the builtin client's form edits, `torrent_listen_port` overrides it whenever it is non-zero (`BuiltinDownloadClient` resolves this), and the endpoint above moves the live socket without touching either. While an override is in force the form's **Listen port** field goes read-only and says so, because editing it there would save happily and change nothing — set the port through `STREAMLINE_TORRENT_LISTEN_PORT`, or move the running engine from Activity → Torrents.

**The three library roots are a special case.** `library.movie_path`, `series_path` and `download_path` show up read-only on Settings → Library and are changed through Settings → Advanced instead. That flow rewrites every stored path in the database and *then* repoints the config; a plain edit would leave every existing file recorded under the old prefix.

Setting `read_only: true` refuses every runtime write, turning the first two rows into ❌ as well.

## CLI

```
streamline [global options] [command]

GLOBAL OPTIONS
  --config, -c <path>    path to config file
  --version, -v          print version
```

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config init [--output <path>]` | Write a default config to stdout or a file |

## Reference

Defaults shown are the built-in ones, as emitted by `streamline config init`.

### Top level

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `data_dir` | string | `./data` | Runtime data (SQLite DB, posters). **Must already exist.** Pin it to an absolute path in containers |
| `read_only` | bool | `false` | Reject all runtime config write-backs. For GitOps deploys |
| `torrent_listen_port` | int | `0` | Overrides the builtin download client's `listen_port`. Top-level so `STREAMLINE_TORRENT_LISTEN_PORT` can reach it — see [torrent_listen_port](#torrent_listen_port) |
| `quality_default_profile` | string | `default` | Profile used when an item names none |

### server

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `server.host` | string | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `server.port` | int | `8080` | 1–65535 |
| `server.trusted_proxies` | []cidr | `[]` | CIDRs whose `X-Forwarded-*` headers are believed. Empty trusts none. List the proxies themselves, ideally a `/32` each — never a client subnet |

### auth

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `auth.mode` | enum | `full` | `full` \| `trusted-network` \| `disabled` — see [Authentication and SSO](Authentication-and-SSO#auth-modes) |
| `auth.trusted_networks` | []cidr | `[]` | CIDRs auto-authenticated when mode is `trusted-network` |
| `auth.trusted_role` | enum | `member` | Role granted to trusted-network requests |
| `auth.session_secret` | string | *generated* | JWT HMAC key |
| `auth.session_secret_file` | path | — | Mutually exclusive with the above |
| `auth.session_ttl` | duration | `168h` | Session lifetime |
| `auth.registration_mode` | enum | `disabled` | `disabled` \| `open` \| `invite` |
| `auth.default_role` | enum | `member` | Role a self-registering user lands on, local or SSO. Fallback only, and `admin` is clamped to `member` — see [Authentication and SSO](Authentication-and-SSO). Renamed from `auth.oidc_default_role`, which is **no longer read at all** |
| `auth.seed_admin.email` | string | `""` | Bootstrap admin. No-op once any user exists |
| `auth.seed_admin.password` | string | `""` | Generated and persisted if left empty |
| `auth.seed_admin.password_file` | path | `""` | Wins over `password` |
| `auth.lockout.threshold` | int | `10` | Failed logins before an account locks |
| `auth.lockout.window` | duration | `15m` | Window those failures are counted over |
| `auth.lockout.duration` | duration | `15m` | How long the lock lasts |
| `auth.oidc[]` | array | `[]` | See [Authentication and SSO](Authentication-and-SSO#oidc) |

Independently of `auth.lockout`, login and registration are rate-limited per IP at **5 attempts / 15 minutes**. That limit is not configurable.

### library

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `library.movie_path` | path | `/media/movies` | Movie library root |
| `library.series_path` | path | `/media/series` | TV library root |
| `library.download_path` | path | `/downloads` | Where Streamline reads finished torrents from. Combined with the torrent name: `<download_path>/<torrent.Name>` |
| `library.movie_naming` | template | `{title} ({year}) {tmdb-{tmdb_id}}/{title} ({year}) [{quality}].{ext}` | See [Quality Profiles and Naming](Quality-Profiles-and-Naming#file-naming) |
| `library.series_naming` | template | `{title} ({year})/Season {season}/{title} - S{season:2}E{episode:2} - {episode_title} [{quality}].{ext}` | |
| `library.import_mode` | enum | `hardlink` | `hardlink` \| `copy` \| `move`. `move` also removes the torrent from its client once the import lands, since it can no longer seed |
| `library.monitor_specials` | bool | `false` | Monitor season 0 on add/discovery. **Runtime-editable** |
| `library.probe.always_ask` | bool | `false` | Hold every import for manual approval instead of importing straight away. Needs no ffprobe. **Runtime-editable** |
| `library.probe.min_duration_ratio` | float | `0.5` | Hold an import when the probed duration falls below this share of the expected runtime — the check for sample clips and truncated remuxes. A ratio, not a percentage: `0.5` is half. Greater than 0, at most 1. **Runtime-editable** |
| `library.no_match_cooldown` | duration | `6h` | Quiet period after a search finds nothing acceptable |
| `library.max_grab_failures` | int | `3` | Consecutive failures before an item is marked failed |
| `library.keep_torrent_seeding` | bool | `true` | Leave torrents seeding after import. Ignored under `import_mode: move`: a moved torrent has nothing left to seed, so it is removed from the client, with any files the import left behind, as soon as its record imports |
| `library.import_max_attempts` | int | `3` | Import retries before giving up |
| `library.allowed_download_roots` | []path | `[]` | If non-empty, a torrent's save path must sit under one of these or import is refused. Security fence — empty disables the check |
| `library.drift_grace_ticks` | int | `3` | Consecutive `drift_check` ticks a file may be missing before its record is deleted (1–20). At the default 15m interval, 3 ticks ≈ 45 minutes of tolerance for a flaky mount |

#### Import verification

When ffprobe is available (see [`ffmpeg`](#ffmpeg)), Streamline checks a finished
download against what the release claimed *before* moving anything into the
library. A file that fails is not imported and not discarded: the record moves
to `held` and waits for you in Activity → Queue, with one reason per failed
check.

| Check | Holds when |
| --- | --- |
| `corrupt` | ffprobe cannot read the file (reported alone — nothing else is knowable) |
| `resolution` | The probed resolution is *below* what the release name claimed. Classified by width, so a 1920×800 scope film still counts as 1080p. Higher than claimed never holds |
| `duration` | Probed duration is under `library.probe.min_duration_ratio` × the title's runtime. Skipped when the runtime is unknown |
| `codec` | The profile's `allowed_codecs` is non-empty and the probed video codec is not in it |
| `always_ask` | `library.probe.always_ask` is on and nothing else objected |

A season pack is verified whole: any bad file holds the entire pack before any
file is moved. Resolve a hold from the UI, or with
`POST /api/v1/downloads/{id}/resolve` — see
[REST API](REST-API#resolving-a-held-download).

With ffmpeg disabled or the binary missing, only `always_ask` can hold anything;
every other check is skipped and imports behave as before.

### schedules

All values are Go duration strings, runtime-editable, pausable and runnable on demand — see [Scheduled Jobs](Scheduled-Jobs).

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `schedules.download_monitor` | duration | `30s` | |
| `schedules.import_scan` | duration | `60s` | |
| `schedules.movie_rss_sync` | duration | `15m` | |
| `schedules.tv_rss_sync` | duration | `15m` | |
| `schedules.movie_missing_search` | duration | `12h` | |
| `schedules.tv_missing_search` | duration | `12h` | |
| `schedules.media_probe` | duration | `15m` | |
| `schedules.movie_orphan_scan` | duration | `6h` | |
| `schedules.tv_orphan_scan` | duration | `6h` | |
| `schedules.drift_check` | duration | `15m` | |
| `schedules.cleanup` | duration | `24h` | |
| `schedules.movie_metadata_refresh` | duration | `24h` | |
| `schedules.tv_metadata_refresh` | duration | `24h` | |
| `schedules.file_selection` | duration | `30s` | |

**Deprecated aliases**, still honoured with a warning at boot: `rss_sync` (→ `movie_rss_sync`), `missing_search`, `metadata_refresh` and `orphan_scan` (each → both the `movie_*` and `tv_*` keys).

### metadata

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata.tmdb_api_key` | string | `""` | **Required for movies.** No key, no movie search |
| `metadata.tvdb_api_key` | string | `""` | **Required for TV.** |
| `metadata.language` | BCP-47 | `en` | Empty lets the provider pick its own default |
| `metadata.tmdb_region` | ISO 3166-1 α-2 | `FR` | Uppercase. Drives which country's digital release dates feed the calendar — set it to yours |

Both keys have `_file` twins.

### ffmpeg

Backs the media probe feature: technical details (resolution, codecs, duration, bitrate) read from your files with `ffprobe` and shown as `media_info` on movies and episodes. See [REST API](REST-API#media-probe).

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ffmpeg.enabled` | bool | `true` | Turns probing off entirely. **Runtime-editable** |
| `ffmpeg.path` | path | `""` | A **directory** holding the `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` binaries — not a binary path. Empty resolves via `$PATH`. Read once at boot; changing it needs a restart |

Missing binaries (or `enabled: false`) degrade gracefully — imports and library scans work exactly as they did before this feature existed, just without `media_info`. Nothing errors at boot. `GET /api/v1/system/info` surfaces `ffmpeg_warn: true` when probing is enabled but ffprobe wasn't found; the official Docker image ships the binaries, so this only bites custom builds or `path` misconfiguration.

`ffmpeg.path` also supplies the binary the [transcoder](#transcoding) runs. Both binaries are resolved out of that one directory, so there is no separate `ffmpeg_path` to set — and `ffprobe` being found does not prove `ffmpeg` is: `GET /api/v1/config/ffmpeg` reports a `version` field only when `ffmpeg -version` actually answers.

### transcoding

Background re-encoding of imported media. The *rules* live on each quality profile (`quality_profiles[].transcode`, below); this block is only the master switch and the budget. Off by default.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `transcoding.enabled` | bool | `false` | Master switch. While off nothing is claimed and every `/api/v1/transcoding/*` endpoint answers `409`. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.max_concurrent` | int | `1` | 1–8. How many encodes run at once. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.max_failures` | int | `3` | 1–10. Attempts a job gets before it parks as `failed`. A retry from the queue resets the counter. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.hw_accel` | string | `auto` | `auto`, `none` or `vaapi`. `auto` probes `hw_device` once and uses VAAPI when the probe passes and the policy's `to.video_codec` has a VAAPI encoder, software otherwise, decided per job; `none` forces software; `vaapi` requires the hardware — where `auto` would fall back, `vaapi` puts the job back on the queue for an hour instead (no attempt spent) and probes the device again on the next job, so a failed probe never silently turns into a CPU encode. Needs an ffmpeg built with libva: the default image has none, see [Hardware encoding](Installation#hardware-encoding-vaapi). Changing it re-probes on the next job. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.hw_device` | string | `/dev/dri/renderD128` | The render node VAAPI opens. Must be passed into a container and be writable by the process (the host's `render` group). Changing it re-probes on the next job. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.defer_seeding` | bool | `false` | Defer a transcoding job while the torrent that produced its file is still downloading or seeding in its download client. A file with no download record, or whose torrent has stopped seeding or left the client, is encoded right away. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.verify.max_size_percent` | int | `100` | 0–200. Reject a transcode whose output exceeds this share of the source size. Remuxes are exempt. `0` disables. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.verify.min_size_percent` | int | `5` | 0–100. Reject any output under this share of the source — a dropped stream or a truncated encode. `0` disables. Must stay below `max_size_percent`. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.verify.health_check` | bool | `false` | Fully decode the output before the swap. One extra decode pass per job. **Runtime-editable** |
| `transcoding.verify.min_vmaf` | int | `0` | 0–100. Reject a transcode whose mean VMAF over three 60 s windows falls below this. Needs an ffmpeg built with libvmaf; skipped with a log line otherwise. `0` disables. **Runtime-editable** |

A rejected encode lands on the queue as `rejected` with both sizes and the check that condemned it, and the original file is untouched. It is never retried on its own — the same encode gives the same file — and the scan skips it; **Retry** on the Transcoding page asks again after the band or the policy has changed.

None of these keys is read at boot, so a change needs no restart: `enabled` and `max_concurrent` are read at every worker tick, and `max_failures` when a job fails. Turning `enabled` off does not interrupt an encode already running; it stops the next one from starting. `hw_accel` and `hw_device` are probed the first time a job needs them and the result is kept until either key changes, so a fixed device passthrough takes effect on the next job with no restart — except under `hw_accel: vaapi`, where a job held back for the missing hardware also drops that result, so a device that comes back is picked up on the next job. The view reports `hw_status` (`off`, `ready` or `unavailable`) and, when unavailable, `hw_reason` with the probe's error.

The worker needs `ffmpeg` itself, not just `ffprobe`. With `ffmpeg.enabled: false`, or with the binary missing, the worker stays idle and **Scan library** refuses with a `409` rather than queueing rows nothing would ever drain. The official Docker image ships both binaries.

### log

Two independent loggers: `log.app` (application) and `log.http` (access log).

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `log.app.enabled` | bool | `true` | |
| `log.app.level` | enum | `info` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` |
| `log.app.format` | enum | `text` | `text` \| `json` |
| `log.app.output` | string | `stderr` | `stderr`, an absolute path, or a path relative to `data_dir` |
| `log.http.enabled` | bool | `true` | |
| `log.http.format` | enum | `json` | `json` \| `combined` (combined uses RFC3339 timestamps, not the Apache format) |
| `log.http.output` | string | `stderr` | As above |

Both take a `rotate` block, applied when output is a file path:

| Key | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `rotate.max_size_mb` | `100` |
| `rotate.max_backups` | `5` |
| `rotate.max_age_days` | `30` |
| `rotate.compress` | `true` |

### otel

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `otel.endpoint` | string | `""` | OTLP endpoint. Empty disables export entirely |
| `otel.insecure` | bool | `false` | Send OTLP over plaintext HTTP. Required for an `http://` collector |
| `otel.sample_ratio` | number | `0.05` | Head sampling rate for root spans, `0`–`1`. Ignored when `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` is set |
| `otel.environment` | string | `""` | Fills the `deployment.environment` resource attribute (e.g. `prod`, `staging`) |

The OTel SDK defaults to HTTPS. Set `otel.insecure: true` for a plaintext collector — `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true` still works and does the same thing. See [Observability and Logging](Observability-and-Logging).

`log.app.enabled: false` turns off the stderr log sink only. Traces, metrics and OTLP-exported logs keep flowing as long as `otel.endpoint` is set.

### events

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |

### media_server

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `media_server.plex_client_id` | string | *generated* | `X-Plex-Client-Identifier` |
| `media_server.servers[]` | array | `[]` | |

Per entry:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ | Unique key; the API addresses servers by it |
| `server_type` | ✅ | `plex` \| `jellyfin` \| `emby` |
| `host` | ✅ | Base URL |
| `api_key` / `api_key_file` | | Plex uses the PIN flow instead |
| `enabled` | | |
| `library_section` | | Plex section key holding movies |
| `library_section_tv` | | Plex section key holding TV |

Both section keys are Plex-only. Leave them unset and Streamline looks the section up by matching your library path against the paths Plex reports — which only works when Plex sees the library at the same path Streamline does. In Docker or Kubernetes it usually doesn't (Streamline's `/srv/streamline/movies` is Plex's `/data/movies`), so the lookup misses and Streamline falls back to rescanning **every** section. That works, but it is a bigger scan than you need: set the two keys to scope it. Settings → Media Servers lists the available sections (`POST /api/v1/media-servers/discover`).

### download

Governs [selective file download](First-Run-Setup#selective-file-download) — grabbing an episode-scoped pack downloads only the files that episode needs.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `download.selective_files` | bool | `false` | Off is bit-for-bit today's whole-torrent grab, and the rollback path. **Runtime-editable** |
| `download.selection_grace` | duration | `10m` | How long a magnet-sourced selection may sit unresolved before giving up and downloading the release whole |
| `download.path_mappings` | list of `{from, to}` | `[]` | Translates a save path your download client reports into one Streamline can open. First matching prefix wins. Both sides must be absolute. **Runtime-editable** |

#### Path mappings

For qBittorrent, Streamline sends `library.download_path` as the torrent's explicit `savepath` and tags it with the `streamline` category. This keeps a Streamline-added torrent in the path the importer expects, even when qBittorrent uses Manual torrent management. For torrents added by hand, qBittorrent only applies a category's save path under Automatic Torrent Management; see [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting#an-adopted-torrent-says-files-not-found).

That works as long as both processes see the same files at the same path. In Docker or Kubernetes they often don't: if qBittorrent mounts your media volume at `/data` and Streamline mounts it at `/srv`, every path qBittorrent reports is meaningless to Streamline. `path_mappings` closes that gap:

```yaml
download:
  path_mappings:
    - from: /data      # what the download client calls it
      to: /srv         # what Streamline calls it
```

This is only consulted when a torrent is **not** where Streamline expected it — a normal grab never needs it. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting#an-adopted-torrent-says-files-not-found).

### download_clients

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ | |
| `client_type` | ✅ | `qbittorrent` \| `transmission` \| `deluge` \| `builtin` |
| `host`, `port`, `auth_method` | ✅ unless `builtin` | `auth_method`: `password` \| `api_key` |
| `username`, `password`/`password_file`, `api_key`/`api_key_file` | | Per `auth_method` |
| `use_ssl` | | |
| `priority` | | 0–255, lower is tried first |
| `enabled` | | |

Built-in engine only (ignored for external clients):

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `download_dir` | ✅ for `builtin` | Where the engine writes |
| `listen_port` | | Incoming BitTorrent port. Overridden by [`torrent_listen_port`](#torrent_listen_port) when that is set — required if your VPN assigns a forwarded port per session, since such a port can't live in a file |
| `max_upload_kbps`, `max_download_kbps` | | `0` = unlimited |
| `seed_ratio` | | Stop seeding at this ratio. Uploaded bytes are persisted per torrent and accumulate across restarts, so a restart doesn't hand a torrent back its ratio |
| `seed_time` | | Stop seeding after this duration, measured from the persisted completion time |
| `disable_dht` | | Turns off the distributed hash table. **Recommended on a small machine.** DHT keeps a routing table warm and answers queries from the wider network continuously, whether or not you are downloading — none of which an indexer-driven setup needs, since every torrent here arrives from a tracker that already knows its peers. Left on it costs memory and a steady trickle of background traffic for nothing. Turn it off unless you add magnets by hand and rely on public swarms to find them |
| `bind_interface` | | Bind to one interface — useful for a VPN tunnel |

Once `seed_ratio` or `seed_time` is reached, the built-in engine stops uploading and streamline then removes that torrent **and deletes its files** — but only when the download was already imported into your library, which is the point at which the download copy is a second copy of a file you already have. A torrent still waiting on you (a held import, an adoption proposal) or one streamline never grabbed is left alone, and external clients keep their own ratio handling and their own files.

The built-in engine treats what a release names as untrusted:

- It holds at most **500 torrents**. A grab past that is refused with a message saying so; remove finished torrents to make room.
- It won't announce to a tracker, fetch a webseed or pull metadata from an address on the machine itself (loopback), on its link (link-local, which includes the `169.254.169.254` cloud metadata endpoint), or a multicast one. Private LAN addresses are fine, so a tracker on your homelab still works. Peer addresses and DHT nodes embedded in a magnet are ignored; the trackers and DHT find the swarm.
- It refuses a torrent whose name is empty, `.`, `..`, `.streamline-session`, contains a path separator, or is already used by another torrent it holds. Any of those would land on data that isn't the torrent's. It also refuses a torrent whose name is already on disk with files of different sizes, or with a half-finished `.part` download it doesn't own: that is another release's data. Re-adding the same torrent over its own complete files is fine.

### indexers

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ | |
| `host`, `port` | ✅ | |
| `protocol` | ✅ | `torznab` \| `prowlarr` |
| `path` | | Torznab endpoint path |
| `api_key` / `api_key_file` | | |
| `use_ssl` | | |
| `priority` | | 0–255, lower first |
| `enabled` | | |

### quality_profiles

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ | Referenced by `quality_default_profile` and per-title |
| `preferred_resolution` | ✅ | `720p` \| `1080p` \| `2160p` — hard ceiling of the accepted band |
| `min_resolution` | ✅ | Same set — hard floor |
| `upgrade_allowed` | | Whether a file already on disk can be replaced by a higher-scoring release. See [Quality Profiles and Naming](Quality-Profiles-and-Naming) |
| `allowed_codecs` | | ffprobe codec names (`hevc`, `av1`, `h264`, `vp9`, `mpeg2video`). Empty — the default — means any codec. A finished download whose video codec isn't listed is [held](#import-verification) for a decision rather than imported |
| `formats` | | `[{name, score}]` — custom formats (built-in or `custom_formats`) scored for this profile. See [Quality Profiles and Custom Formats](Quality-Profiles-and-Custom-Formats) |
| `min_score` | | Minimum total matched-format score a release needs to be grabbed. Default `0` |
| `upgrade_until_score` | | Stop upgrading once the current file's score reaches this value. `0` (default) means no cap |
| `transcode` | | Post-import re-encode rules for files on this profile. Absent — the default — means they are never re-encoded. Needs `transcoding.enabled`. Full reference: [Quality Profiles and Custom Formats](Quality-Profiles-and-Custom-Formats#transcoding-a-profiles-files) |

`transcode` is a nested `{if, to}` block:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `if.video_codecs` | | Codecs considered acceptable: `h264` `hevc` `av1` `vp9` `mpeg4` `mpeg2video` `vc1`. Empty means any |
| `if.containers` | | Containers considered acceptable: `mkv` `mp4` `avi` `mov` `ts` `m2ts` `webm` `wmv`. Empty means any |
| `if.max_video_bitrate` | | Ceiling as an ffmpeg-style rate — `8M`, `4500k`. Empty means no bitrate rule. Read off the video stream where the file records one, and otherwise off the **container's total bitrate**, which includes every audio track — mkv rarely records a per-stream rate, so that fallback is the usual case. Leave headroom for the audio, or files whose video is already under the ceiling get queued |
| `if.min_video_bitrate` | | Floor as an ffmpeg-style rate — `2M`, `1500k`. A source below it is exempt from the **codec** rule only: the ceiling and the container rule still apply. Constant-quality encoding is bitrate-blind, so re-encoding an already-lean h264 file usually makes it bigger — this is how you say "leave those alone". Read off the same figure as the ceiling, so on mkv it is the container total and the floor wants headroom too. Must be below `if.max_video_bitrate` when both are set. Empty means no floor |
| `to.container` | ✅ | `mkv` \| `mp4`. **mp4 keeps video and audio only** — subtitle streams and font attachments are dropped, because mp4 cannot carry SRT/ASS/PGS or attachments at all. `mkv` keeps everything |
| `to.video_codec` | ✅ | `h264` \| `hevc` \| `av1` |
| `to.crf` | | 0–51, lower is bigger and better. `0` (or omitted) leaves `-crf` out, so the encoder's default applies — libx264 23, libx265 28, libsvtav1 35 |
| `to.preset` | ✅ | `ultrafast` … `veryslow` — the usual x264/x265 ladder |
| `to.audio_codec` | ✅ | `aac` \| `opus` \| `ac3` \| `flac`. Applied only to tracks not covered by `audio_passthrough` |
| `to.audio_passthrough` | | Source audio codecs copied rather than re-encoded. Empty applies the built-in list: `truehd eac3 ac3 dts aac opus flac` |

A file failing **any** `if` rule is queued. HDR and Dolby Vision video is exempt from the codec and bitrate rules — it is never re-encoded — but a container remux still applies to it.

**The destination has to satisfy the test.** A `to.video_codec` missing from a non-empty `if.video_codecs`, or a `to.container` missing from a non-empty `if.containers`, is refused at load with a message naming both keys: the encode would land, the next pass would read its own output as non-compliant, and the file would be re-encoded forever with every job reporting success. The one loop that cannot be caught this way is a `crf` output that comes out above `max_video_bitrate` — set the ceiling with headroom, not at the rate you are aiming for.

**Do not combine a `transcode` block with a `formats` entry that scores a `size` condition's `min_gb` positively.** A transcode's whole point is a smaller file, and the row is re-probed from the encode — so the shrunk file scores below the release that produced it and looks upgradable to the RSS feed forever after.

One profile named `default` (1080p/1080p, upgrades allowed, no formats) ships out of the box.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With *no* quality profiles configured at all, every release is rejected. Grabbing at an unknown quality bar is treated as worse than grabbing nothing.

### custom_formats

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ | Must not collide with a built-in format name |
| `description` | | Optional free text, shown on the format's row and as a hint wherever it's scored. No effect on matching |
| `conditions` | ✅ | At least one `{type, ...}` condition. Full type reference and matching semantics: [Quality Profiles and Custom Formats](Quality-Profiles-and-Custom-Formats) |

Ten formats (x265, x264, av1, remux, hdr, resolution tiers, multi-audio, dubbed) ship compiled into the binary and need no config entry — `custom_formats` is only for your own. They all *describe* a release and none of them judges one: group blocklists and rip-source opinions are preference, so they're yours to write here rather than ours to ship.
